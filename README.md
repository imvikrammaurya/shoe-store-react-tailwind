## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into modern frontend styling and logic. Key takeaways include:

- **Tailwind v4 Configuration:** Learned how to use the new `@theme` and `@variant` directives in CSS to create custom animations and handle dark mode without a traditional `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Complex State Management:** Managing the state of the Shopping Cart (adding items, updating quantities) and passing data between siblings using Props and State lifting.
- **Component Reusability:** Created modular components like `Card`, `Select`, and `Nav` to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- **CSS Animations:** mastered `@keyframes` within Tailwind to create engaging "wiggle" and "float" effects that enhance user engagement.
